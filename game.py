Stray is a a small text adventure game. The game let's you take on the role of a captain of
a spaceship called "Stray". Over the course of the game you will have to make decisions that
will affect the outcome of the game. Will you be rewarded for your brave deeds or will you
die in the depths of space? It's up to you!

Main features:
- An immersive story
